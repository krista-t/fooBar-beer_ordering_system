# FooBar - school project

A platform created to serve as FooBar's in bar system.

The first part was created to be presented on big screens across the bar where clients can see their order on queue and when it's their time to be served, along with a chart showcasing the bar's most popular beers at any given time.

The second part was to be used on the tablets found across every table at the bar or the client's personal devices - a purchase workflow, from products to payment getaway.
